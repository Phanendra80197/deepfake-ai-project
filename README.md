## Introduction

This project presents a comprehensive approach to detecting and preventing deepfake images using advanced AI techniques. Leveraging machine learning algorithms and neural networks, the system is designed to identify and mitigate the effects of manipulated images.

Whether you're a researcher, developer, or AI enthusiast, this project provides tools and insights for understanding and countering deepfakes effectively.

## Usage

To run the application locally:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Phanendra80197/deepfake-ai-project.git
   cd deepfake-ai-project

#Install dependencies
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.


#pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application


streamlit run app.py
Use the App

#Upload an image using the web interface.

The AI model will analyze the image and output whether it's real or deepfake along with an explanation.

#Tools
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

OpenCV

Streamlit

PyCharm (for development)

#Results
Here are example features of the system:

Real-time classification of images as Real or Fake

Visual explanations for model predictions

Simple and user-friendly web interface
